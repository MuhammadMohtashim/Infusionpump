# Infusion Pump
An infusion Pump I created by sourcing many online sources. I wanted to create an Infusion pump that would be based on an Arduino, was user friendly and easy to create at home.  

The first source I used was Karpova's Syringe Pump. I have tweaked the original laser cut design to make it more robust and stable. The original design had only one guding rod. This made it very unstable in my testing and oeprations. Ergo, I added another guiding rod to make it more stable. The link to the original repo is given below.

But Karapova's pump is STM based and I wanted an Arduino based system so I used code, electronics and the controller case from Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of Moscow State University.
